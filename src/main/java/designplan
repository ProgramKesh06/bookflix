when adding a book or member you use the same filename as current so when u do writre it will delete everything from file and everything should be rewritten
if anything needs to be done for a new user just put in defalt values of my choice for all existsting users
only when asked for recommendeds u must recalculate the vector score
for the username for that book put that rateing.

for rateings if u need arraylist from other class make method and put in arraylist as parameter so in mian u can call and put araaylist from other classes
use .get arraylst in rating classs to add to that array list the rating
do all writing into files in main method
put years in manually for each user and read them in in the members class and them to array
put in while loop
string [] var = line.split (:);
string [] var2 = var[0].split (,);
.add by var2[0]
.add by var2[0]



        add name and year like first line of rating file hard code
        get the real name by reading that file and redo the persons class

        ratings class needs to add that rating to a array list and should get do file . writer in main
